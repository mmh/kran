## Usage
Run ``` kran ``` to see usage

# krog
Supposed to make it easier to write scripts for the containers

## Installation
Link into $PATH like kran

Writing a krog hook, each line is prefixed with one of the 4 following keywords.
Lines without one of these, will be ignored.

```
# Execute command locally
RUN

# Execute command in container
SSH 

# Copy a file to the container
ADD

# Write a message for the user
MSG
```

Variables available in a kran hook
```
$1 to $4, first to fourth argument (after hook name)
$ARGS, all arguments (after hook name)

```

Sample (download and install drupal):
~/.krog/hooks/install-drupal:
```
# Telling the user what will happen
MSG Download and install drupal
# Delete old public_html and download drupal to public_html
SSH cd /var/www && rm -r public_html && drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=public_html
# run drush site-intall give site name from first argument
SSH cd /var/www/public_html && drush -y site-install standard --db-url=mysql://db:db@localhost/db --site-name=$1
```

executed with (from kran dir).
```
krog install-drupal sitename
```
